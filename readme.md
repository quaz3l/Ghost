#####Just a blogging platform


Ghost is [John O'Nolan's](http://john.onolan.org/) fictional idealistic concept of a blogging platform. It has only one purpose: to enable people with more important ideas than him and I to publish their ideas as quickly, fluidly and as easy as possible. 

Ghost does the hard work so you can focus on your ideas, and content.
